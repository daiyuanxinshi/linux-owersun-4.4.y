Rockchip SoCs LVDS interface
================================

Required properties:
- compatible: matching the soc type, one of
	- "rockchip,px30-lvds";
	- "rockchip,rk3126-lvds";
	- "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
	- "rockchip,rk3368-lvds";
- phys : phandle for the PHY device
- phy-names : should be "phy"

Required nodes:

The lvds has two video ports as described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.
Their connections are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.

- video port 0 for the VOP inputs
- video port 1 for either a panel or subsequent encoder

the lvds panel described by
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/simple-panel.txt

- rockchip,data-mapping: should be "vesa" or "jeida",
	This describes how the color bits are laid out in the
	serialized LVDS signal.
- rockchip,data-width : should be <18> or <24>;
- rockchip,output: should be "lvds" or "duallvds",
	This describes the output face.
- ports for remote LVDS output

Example:

&grf {
	lvds: lvds {
		compatible = "rockchip,rk3288-lvds";
		pinctrl-names = "default", "sleep";
		pinctrl-0 = <&lcdc_rgb_pins>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&lcdc_sleep_pins>;
		phys = <&video_phy>;
		phy-names = "phy";
		status = "disabled";

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				#address-cells = <1>;
				#size-cells = <0>;

				lvds_in_vopb: endpoint@0 {
					reg = <0>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopb_out_lvds>;
				};

				lvds_in_vopl: endpoint@1 {
					reg = <1>;
					remote-endpoint = <&vopl_out_lvds>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
};
